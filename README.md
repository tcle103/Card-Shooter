Gallery shooter - with a card-based twist! 
Heavily inspired by Balatro.

Most art assets by Kenney - specifically their [1-Bit Input Prompts Pixel 16x](https://kenney.nl/assets/1-bit-input-prompts-pixel-16) pack, their [Casino Audio](https://kenney.nl/assets/casino-audio) pack, and especially their [Playing Cards Pack](https://kenney.nl/assets/playing-cards-pack), which I very lightly edited. Their stuff is fantastic!

Fonts used are [Super Pixel Font](https://www.fontspace.com/super-pixel-font-f112028) by All Super Font and [Shape Bit Font Pixel](https://www.fontspace.com/shape-bit-font-f103098) by ahweproject, both of which are fine for noncommercial/personal use. Thank you very much!

 ** CONTROLS: A/D or arrow keys to move your player character, [SPACE] to fire
